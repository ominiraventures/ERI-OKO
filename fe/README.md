# INATrace

Open-source blockchain-based track and trace system for an agricultural commodities (such as coffee) supply
chain run. It provides transparency and creation of trust through
digitalization of supply chains, connects every actor along the supply chain, assures quality and fair pricing.

Project is composed of 3 parts:

* [Angular frontend](https://github.com/INATrace/fe/tree/main)
* [Java backend](https://github.com/INATrace/backend/tree/main)
* [Coffee network](https://github.com/INATrace/coffee-network/tree/main)

## How it works

### Welcome page

This is the welcome page at [inatrace.org](https://inatrace.org/). From here, existing users can login by clicking "Login" in the top right corner. New users can click on "Read more" button, where they can get more info on how to get registered. 

![INAtrace welcome](docs/images/inatrace_welcome.png)

### Registration

New users must enter their name, surname, email and password. The terms and conditions have to be accepted. The submitted email address receives a confirmation link to confirm the email address. After confirming the email, a system admin must activate the account.

![INAtrace registration](docs/images/inatrace_register.png)

### Home

![INAtrace home](docs/images/inatrace_home.png)

This is the home page. In the left sidebar from top to bottom, we have the following links:
- Home
- Company
- Products
- Settings (System admin and Regional admin only)

The current user's products are displayed in the center, along with quick access links to stock, orders, customers, farmers, collectors and dashboard. Collectors quick access is shown only if the current user company has facilities that work with collectors. Customers quick access is shown only if the current user company has "Buyer" role in any Product. 
In the top right corner, an expandable menu contains quick links, user profile settings and a logout button.

If the user has multiple companies, an active company can be selected in the "User profile" section.

![INAtrace_user_profile](docs/images/inatrace_user_profile.png)

### Products

![Products_icon](docs/images/icon-products.svg)

Each company has its products which are visible in the products tab which is opened by clicking the above icon.

#### Product settings

Each product can contain information like name, picture, origin, data about social responsibility, enviromental sustainability, etc. This is defined in the "Product settings".

#### QR labels

For traceability, QR labels with product information are created here.

![Product_QR_labels](docs/images/inatrace_product_qr.png)

#### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are companies participating in the production of the final product. Companies from the system can be added here. Their roles can be:

- Buyer
- Importer
- Exporter
- Producer
- Association
- Processor
- Trader

![Product_stakeholders](docs/images/inatrace_product_stakeholders.png)

#### Final products

Final products are retail products for sale to the end customers.

![Product_final_products](docs/images/inatrace_product_final_product.png)

#### B2C settings

The public facing B2C page has editable colors, fonts and content to allow for corporate identity compliance. The settings are visible on `Product settings` and `QR labels` tabs.

The B2C configuration on the `Product settings` is automatically inherited by QR labels. If QR labels define another value, this value overrides the product values. This way QR labels inherit product settings by default, but can be changed on a label-by-label basis.

The following values can be customized:
- Colors
  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Ternary
  - Quaternary
  - Header
  - Text
- Enable/disable tabs
  - Fair prices
  - Producers
  - Quality
  - Feedback
- Font (TTF, WOFF and WOFF2)
  - Product
  - Text
- Images
  - Header (PNG, JPG and JPEG)
  - Header background (PNG, JPG, JPEG and SVG)
  - Footer (PNG, JPG and JPEG)

![Product_B2C_settings](docs/images/b2c_settings.png)

### Companies

![Company_payments](docs/images/inatrace_company_payments.png)

#### Farmers and collectors

Here, farmers and collectors with their personal and banking details are recorded. For each farmer and collector there is also an aggregation of past payments. Each person has a unique QR code.

![Company_farmers_collectors](docs/images/inatrace_farmer_profile_1.png)
![Company_farmers_collectors](docs/images/inatrace_farmer_profile_2.png)

### Dashboard

The Dashboard contains graphical representation of selected Company data. Currently, there is support for display the Deliveries for selected time frame and displaying processing performance for selected Processing action and time frame.

#### Deliveries

![INAtrace_user_profile](docs/images/inatrace_dashboard_deliveries.png)

![INATrace company](docs/images/inatrace_settings_companies.png)

#### Users

This is the list of system users. To show all users, the "My users" filter needs to be deactivated. Users can be edited, activated, deactivated and promoted or demoted out of the System admin role. Users can also be set as a Regional admin, which can administer resources owned by the companies where the user is part of.

Users who confirmed their emails can be activated by clicking "Activate". After that, they can login and start using the app.

![INArace_users](docs/images/inatrace_settings_users.png)

#### Settings

Under the "Settings" page and "Types" tab, we can find constants and system-level values like Semi-products, Facility types, Measurement units, Processing evidence types, Processing evidence fields and Product types. Add, edit or remove any of these values to fit your use case.

![INAtrace_settings](docs/images/inatrace_settings_types.png)

#### Value chains

Value chains are listed on this tab. From here, create a new or edit an existing value chain. Value chains contains Facility types, Measuring unit types and other constants added in the types settings.

![INAtrace_settings_value_chains](docs/images/inatrace_settings_value_chains_details.png)

#### Currencies

The system supports 168 different currencies, provided by [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). To use a currency, a System or Regional admin has to manually activate it before it can be selected in currency lists.

To search for a currency, click the "Search" button above the enabled or disabled list and type the ISO code or full name.
