# INATrace Mobile App

INATrace is a digital open-source solution designed to enhance the economic conditions of smallholder farmers by improving the traceability of global supply chains. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by GIZ, INATrace provides an efficient internal management system for cooperatives, digitally stores supply chain data, and supports compliance with regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

## Key Features

- **Polygon Mapping & Farmer Profiles**: Create detailed profiles for farmers and map field boundaries using GPS data, ensuring accurate records of cooperative members.

- **Offline Functionality**: Designed for remote areas with limited internet access, the app allows data collection offline, including farmer profiles and GPS data, with automatic synchronization once an internet connection is available.

   ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URI=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_TEST_URI=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_RW_URI=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_DOCUMENTATION_URI=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=
    RN_MAPBOX_MAPS_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN=
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Launch the Expo development server.

```

## Building the App with EAS Build

To create production-ready builds using Expo Application Services (EAS), follow these steps:

1. **Install EAS CLI**: If you haven't already, install the EAS CLI globally.

   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Configure EAS**: Navigate to your project directory and configure EAS.

   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Create a Build**: Initiate the build process for your desired platform (iOS or Android).

   ```bash
   eas build --platform all
   ```

   Follow the prompts to authenticate and select your build profile.

4. **Monitor Build Status**: After initiating the build, monitor its status through the EAS dashboard or the terminal output.

5. **Download the Build**: Once the build completes, download the installation file (APK for Android or IPA for iOS) from the link provided in the terminal or EAS dashboard.

For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the [official EAS Build documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/).
